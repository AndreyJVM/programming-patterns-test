## **Project Overview**

The **School Registration System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify course management and registration for students and administrators. The system allows students to:
- Register for courses.
- View their course schedules.
- Drop courses.

Administrators can:
- Add, update, or remove courses.
- Manage student enrollments.
- Generate reports on student and course data.

This project serves as a practical implementation of key object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, and software design patterns, aligning with the **Programming Patterns** course (420-301-VA) at Vanier College.
