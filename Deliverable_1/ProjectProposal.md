# Project Proposal: School Registration System

## Objective
To develop a basic **School Registration System** that allows students to register for courses, view their schedules, and manage their academic information, focusing on fundamental data structures, unit testing, and object-oriented principles.

## Overview
The system will enable students to:
- Register and drop courses
- View current course schedules

This project will make use of basic data structures such as `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`, and `Queue`, along with interfaces like `Comparable` and `Comparator`. Unit tests will ensure the correctness and efficiency of operations, and Maven will handle external libraries.

## Key Features
1. **Student Portal**:
   - Register for courses (add/drop functionality)
   - View current course schedule

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use **ArrayList** and **LinkedList** for course management
   - Implement **Queue** to manage student registration requests
   - Apply **Comparable** and **Comparator** interfaces for sorting courses

3. **Unit Testing**:
   - Ensure code quality by creating unit tests for each data structure operation (e.g., add, remove)
   - Use JUnit for testing

4. **External Libraries**:
   - Use **Maven** for dependency management and external libraries

5. **Generic Classes**:
   - Implement a **generic data structure** such as `LinkedList` to handle different types of data (e.g., courses and students)

6. **Stream Processing**:
   - Use **Lambda expressions** and **stream processing** to filter courses by time, professor, or level

## Technologies
- **Java** for core logic
- **JUnit** for unit testing
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Lambda expressions** for simplifying code

## Timeframe
- **Week 1-2**: Implement core features (student registration, course management)
- **Week 3-4**: Implement generic data structures and sorting mechanisms (using Comparable and Comparator)
- **Week 5**: Add unit testing and finalize the project

## Expected Outcome
A functional **School Registration System** using basic data structures, unit testing, and stream processing, with a clean and maintainable design. This project will demonstrate a strong understanding of key course concepts such as data structures, unit testing, and stream processing.
